# SurvAE

The attached jupyter notebook is easily readable and allows one to reproduce the results showing SurvAE outperforming other machine learning for survival analysis models. The required libraries and packages needed to run are included in the first cell of the notebook with the MIMIC-IV dataset that can be extracted from the following locations: https://physionet.org/content/mimiciv/2.2/ and https://github.com/EmmaRocheteau/MIMIC-IV-Postgres
